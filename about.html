          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The first ever acknowledged otome is Angelique, which was released in 1994 by Koei in Japan for the Super Famicom and was created by an all-women development team, separate of Koei called Ruby Party.
            The game was initially designed for pre-teen and younger teenage girls but suddenly bacame unexpectedly popular with older teenagers and women in their 20s. In 2021 they continued the Angelique series by bringing out Angelique Luminarise, in which the mc is a 25 year old office worker.
            Angelique sets up the specifics and conventions of women's games such as the focus on romance, easy controls and utilizing other multimedia. The 2nd recognized otome came out in 1997 called Albaria no Otome which was released by Gimmick House and Magical Craft for PC-FX and later for PlayStation.
            The game dynamic is pretty similar to Angelique with the mc (Ashanty) who is a young woman who'll have to choose between being the new sacred protector of a kingdom or pursuing a romance with one of her knights who help her during the game.
            Konami brought out it's first otome game in 2002 called Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side which was very successful, bringing a majority of new fans to the genre. Early otome games usually followed the style of retro shoujo manga with girly heroines, the emphasis of pure tranquil romance and on a more peaceful, stable setting.
            But as the catergory grew, other narrative and gameplay elements were included such as action, adventure and such plots where the heroine can both get the guy and save the world at the same time.  </p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>Usually the goal of these games is to have the chosen partner fall in love and have a relationship with the protagonist, but requirements for gaining a "good end" differ from each game. While the plots of each otome is very different, usually there'll be at least one main female character and several male characters which have varying types.
            The gameplay doesn't particularly focus  on romance, even if there are several characters whose "routes" can be followed. In visual novel examples of the genre, the player proceeds in the story by selecting the dialogue and action choices which affect their relationships in tree format.
            In similation otome games, there's also other gameplay which affects the plot, either by playing minigames or raising stats. The protagonist usually has several parameters, such as looks, style, intelligence, talent, etc., that can can be raised by various activities during the normal gameplay.
            The potential partners usually do require a certain parameter/parameters to be at a certain level for them to develop a relationship with the protagonist. There's also often a pure dating aspect of gameplay in simulations.
            This involves asking and being or being asked on dates by the love interest, doing an activity with them and responding to their questions or comments. The player has a choice of responses and a correct answer will raise your standing with that character.
            A feature that has become common in otome games is having full voice acting throughout the entire game. With the love interests often being voiced by well-known voice actors. At certain points or when certain requirements are passed, special events can occur, often with a "CG" as a reward.
            This CG is a set picture featuring the love interest and sometimes the protagonist in a pose with some dialogue. In a majority of otomes the heroines are not voiced, due to the budget concerns of voicing all of their dialogue.
            However, there are some games with fully voiced heroines, such as Norn9 or Haruka Beyond the Stream of Time.  </p>
